## Representative Projects

### Deep Learning Project

#### Background
In contrast to previous assignments where we primarily utilized Scikit-learn for machine learning models, this project involved using PyTorch to implement neural networks for image classification tasks.

#### Learning Outcomes
- Developed and compared the performance of five different neural network architectures.
- Utilized convolutional layers with kernels to reduce overfitting and improve efficiency.
- Implemented pooling and activation functions.
- Designed custom neural network structures to enhance accuracy.
- Visualized the effects of various factors, such as the number of training epochs, layers, and hyperparameter combinations, on model performance.

### Kaggle Competition

#### Background
In this assignment, we developed a predictive model using data from edX online courses offered by Harvard and MIT. The objective was to predict whether a student would complete an online course based on their activity patterns. We were provided with a training dataset for model development and a test dataset for evaluation, mirroring real-world machine learning applications where models are trained on available data but ultimately assessed on unseen data.

#### Learning Outcomes
- Applied machine learning techniques to solve problems using real-world datasets, enhancing our understanding of model development, evaluation, and deployment.
- Selected and experimented with various models learned throughout the course.
- Assessed the generalization ability of our models.
- Simulated real-world data science work environments, providing a platform to practice and improve our modeling skills.
- Considered the ethical implications of predictive models, particularly their impact on different student groups, fostering an understanding of the broader societal impacts of machine learning.
